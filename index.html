		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>"Once a horse is rescued, we provide medical care, rehabilitation and schooling and then adopt many of them into

			loving, forever homes. Our rescue also provides a permanent sanctuary to elderly and disabled horses that have
	  
			been callously discarded because they are “too old,” “too sick,” or unwanted."</p></p>

    <h2> TRUSTWORTHY AND PROVEN </h2>

		<p>Bright Futures Farm has been a trusted 501(c)(3) charity since 2000. We are accredited by the Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance (TAA) and have been since 2014. Being accredited by TAA means that we have proven, through independent documentation, that we are a transparent organization, use our funds wisely and provide excellent care to the horses at our facility. The TAA inspects our books and our facility several times a year.

      <p>We receive no funding from state or federal agencies. We rely solely on YOUR donations for support. Your financial support provides the food, supplements and care each horse here needs to stay healthy in their golden years, and most of our seniors live well into their thirties because of the care that you help provide. </p>

		  <p>Making a donation will allow us to continue to do what we do best…save horses that are suffering, abused, and neglected and provide long-term care to the very senior permanent residents that call BFF home. The horses we rescued from the hanging barn in 2016 were with us just five months. Because of their dire condition, it cost over $18,000 to make them healthy again. Medical expenses for the six horses from the hanging barn alone were over $10,000 and funds raised for their care totaled $8,500…well short of what was needed.

The DONATE button below will allow you to make a one-time donation of any amount, or sign up to be a monthly sponsor. And, please check with your employer to see if they will match your donation and DOUBLE your support. Many do.</p>

	  <p>Bright Futures Farm (BFF) has been rescuing, rehabbing, retraining and finding homes for horses at risk and in need for over 20 years. TCA has provided financial support to Bright Futures Farm for just as long, helping us fund much needed care for those horses in transition and the permanent residents who call BFF home forever. Thank you to TCA for supporting our mission and helping our horses be as healthy as they can be. We appreciate their support. Visit TCA on the Web: THOROUGHBRED CHARITIES OF AMERICA

	<p>THANK YOU, THOROUGHBRED AFTERCARE ALLIANCE
		How many people can say they look forward to an inspection? We can! For years Bev Dee, our founder, has talked about the lack of transparency in other animal “welfare” non profits - organizations whose focus wasn’t necessarily 100% on the animals it vowed to care for. Bright Futures Farm always has been just that. And, Bright Futures Farm is proud to say they have been accredited by the Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance (TAA) since 2014. To become accredited is a long and meticulous process - and it is a process that involves not just one inspection - but at least two every year.
